## Greetings 👋

I am requiemDigital - RD for short - and I am a host of different things. To umbrella those things, I am an aspiring Full-Stack Web 
Developer and Solo Game Developer who is certified in Cybersecurity and eager to break into the field - with permission of course.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a mobster game that will rival Electronic Arts' The Godfather
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, SQL, Python, and PHP
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mods for LSPD First Response! My hours spent playing GTA V skyrocketed after finding this gem.
So of course I want to contribute!

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building my network. I'd love to have contacts in my fields of interest.
  
- 💬 Ask me about my latest game development project.
  
- 📫 How to reach me: requiemdigital@proton.me works neatly.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are flying fish in the world. Who knew?! Surely not me.
