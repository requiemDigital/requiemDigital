<h2> Who Are My Hereauxs?</h2>


<p id="legend">They are Dart Feld...</p>

<img id="dart" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/deathbattlefanon/images/1/1c/The_Legend_of_Dragoon_-_Dart_Feld_in_Dragoon_form.png/revision/latest?cb=20160418063742" alt="Image of Dart Feld in Dragoon Form." style="float:right;width:500px;height:510px;">

<p id="legend2" class="dragoon" style="float:none;">Dart is a very courageous and strong-willed young man with a strong sense of justice. He will jump headfirst into danger to save those he cares about, which he does repeatedly, especially with Shana. Although at one point Shana notes that he's had trouble speaking with courtesy, this is ironically not seen very much since throughout the game, he is generally very respectful both towards his allies and many of the other people he meets throughout his journey. He is also quite generous and kind-hearted, willing to help those in need on multiple occasions whether it coincides with his main quest or not. Additionally, and ironically, while he's noted to have been more of a loner in the past, and doesn't seem himself as a leader, he ends up attracting many allies over the course of the game due to his strong drive, determination and affable personality.</p>

<p class="dragoon">While he's usually pretty serious and straightforward, Dart also has a bit of a sense of humor that comes out in less serious situations; depending on how he answers at certain points where he has multiple choices of dialogue, he can be pretty sarcastic, especially towards Shana, albeit in a lighthearted, poking fun type of manner. However, he's also a bit of a straight man to Meru and Haschel's antics, shaking his head at some of the things they do and say or having to reel them in at times, such as when they interfere with the food preparation for the banquet King Zior holds in their honor in after they liberate Tiberoa due to them wanting to sample some of it early.</p>

<p class="dragoon">Coinciding with the element of fire he's associated with as a Dragoon, Dart is quite passionate and expresses his emotions pretty openly. While this generally manifests in positive ways, he also has moments where he can be driven to anger and even a desire for vengeance, as demonstrated with his initial desire to to get revenge on the Black Monster for destroying his hometown and killing many people he cared about, including his parents (at or so he believed), and his similar anger towards Lloyd after he killed Lavitz. However, even in those situations, Dart is shown to be open-minded and willing to let go of his desire for revenge when the characters in question have more layered motives than they initially seemed, express remorse for their actions or otherwise show redeeming qualities; when he discovered Rose was the Black Monster, he has rather upset at first, but he managed to forgive her very quickly after processing that she had to take on the unenviable task of committing her atrocities out of a necessity to prevent the world's destruction and continued both viewing and treating her like an ally. Similarly, he even spared Lloyd when he finally confronted him after the Third Divine Sister Wink stepped between them and urged him to forgive him, as well as revealed he had saved her twice when he didn't have to. Despite still harboring some anger toward him, he saw that he wasn't entirely evil, acknowledged that killing him wouldn't bring back those he killed like Lavitz, and even grew to somewhat respect his motives when he found out he did everything he did to create a utopia.</p>

<p id="dw" style="float:none;">They are Zhao Yun...</p>

<p id="dw2" class="shu" style="float:none;"> Zhao Yun was born from Changshan, Ji Province. He was originally a servant of Yuan Shao, the northern warlord who dominated Ji, Qing, Bing, and You provinces. As a young warrior, he served in the Yellow Turban Campaign and took part in the defeat of the Yellow Turbans in Ji. However, after this battle, he learned that Yuan Shao was only a braggart concerned with the glory of the Yuan Family, and Zhao Yun went to serve Gongsun Zan.</p>

<p class="shu">In 190 AD, he joined the Allied Forces at the Battle of Hulao Gate and was among Gongsun Zan's "White Riders", a group of stallion-riding cavalrymen. During this battle he was acquainted with Liu Bei, and in 194, apologized for his breach of duty and that fled to join Liu Bei, who was fighting Cao Cao in Xu Province. He saved the day, assisting Lord Tao Qian, and later participated in the battles of Changshan, Yijing (where Gongsun Zan was decimated), and Guandu, where he escorted Liu Bei off the battlefield.</p>


<p class="shu">Zhao Yun's first major battle was the Battle of Runan in 200 AD. After Guandu, Liu Bei announced that he would capture the capital, and Zhao Yun fought Cao Cao's bodyguard, Xu Chu to a draw while Cao Cao attacked Liu Bei in the Rang Mountains. In Runan, he solidified his loyalty to Liu Bei by rescuing him from three of Cao Cao's soldiers, and he also slew General Gao Lan, who had killed Liu Pi. Zhao Yun continued to fight for Liu Bei into 207 AD, taking part in the defeat of Xiahou Dun at Bowang Po, and a year later, he saved Liu Bei's son, Liu Shan from behind enemy lines. He also took the Sword of Trust from Xiahou En, Cao Cao's nephew, who he killed.</p>

<p class="shu">Zhao Yun was praised by Liu Bei, and Liu Bei was happier to see Zhao Yun alive than his son. Zilong distinguished himself in the campaign for Jing Province in 209 AD, defeating the Prefect of Guiyang, Zhao Fan, and killing his generals, Bao Long and Chen Ying. He also fought in the campaign against Liu Zhang from 211 to 215 AD, taking part in the Battle of Luo Castle along with Pang Tong. He became one of the Five Tiger Generals of Shu for his services in the Hanzhong Campaign of 218 AD, and also saved his lord again at the Battle of Yiling in 222 AD (although it involved incapacitating him).</p>

<p class="shu">After Liu Bei's death in 223 AD, Zhao Yun ably served his strategist Zhuge Liang. He fought in the Nanman Campaign, where he killed ferocious warrior, Jinhuan Sanjie, and also the Northern Campaign, where he killed Wei general, Han De and his sons, Han Qiong, Han Ying, Han Yao, and Han Qi at the Battle of Tianshui in 228. Zhao Yun died a year later in Hanzhong Commandery, the only one of the Five Tiger Generals to die of natural causes.</p>

<p id="dwmain">They are Lu Bu...</p>

<img id="lu" src="https://pre00.deviantart.net/c9a4/th/pre/i/2016/103/c/1/lu_bu_chibi_by_skreigh-d9yujvn.png" alt="Image of Lu Bu on Red Hare." style="float:right;width:800px;height:810px;">

<p id="dw3" class="dynasty" style="float:none;">Lü Bu, styled Fengxian, was a man from Jiuyuan in Wuyuan Commandery. Known for his prowess, he was recommended for service in Bing Province. When the provincial Inspector, Ding Yuan, was promoted to be Chief Commander of the Cavalry and was stationed at Henei, he employed Lü Bu as his Master of Records, and entrusted much to him.</p>

<p class="dynasty">When Emperor Ling died, Ding Yuan led his troops to pay his respects at Luoyang. He plotted with He Jin to exterminate the eunuchs, and was made Commander of the Imperial Guard.</p>

<p class="dynasty">However, He Jin failed, and Dong Zhuo entered the capital city. Dong Zhuo planned to create chaos, and his first intention was to kill Ding Yuan and annex his military command.</p>

<p class="dynasty">Knowing that Lü Bu was greatly trusted by Ding Yuan, he lured Lü Bu into killing him. Lü Bu followed through and brought Ding Yuan’s head back to Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo bestowed the title of Chief Commander of the Cavalry upon Lü Bu; and, being so fond of him, he and Dong Zhuo swore to be as father and son.</p>

<p class="dynasty">Lü Bu was an adept archer and rider and his arm strength was unmatched. He was nicknamed the “Flying General”. A little later, he was promoted to “General of the Interior”, and given the title of Marquis of Duting. Since Dong Zhuo knew that he treated others without much courtesy he was always in fear of being murdered, and for this reason had Lü Bu guard him wherever he went.</p>
